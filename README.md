# Browser
### A very work-in-progress Arc-inspired browser for macOS.

## Motivation

This browser **—still without a name or icon—** is just a fun side project to sharpen my Swift and SwiftUI skills. It’s highly experimental and unstable, so it’s not meant for real use.
## Technologies

- _SwiftUI_: Powers the app's entire user interface.
- _SwiftData_: Persists data such as Spaces and Tabs.
- _WebKit_: The Browser's Engine.

## Building

In order to build and run the app, a WebKit.framework is neccessary in the `WebView/WebKit` folder. This can be obtained at the [WebKit Build Archives page](https://webkit.org/build-archives/#mac-sequoia-x86_64%20arm64).
